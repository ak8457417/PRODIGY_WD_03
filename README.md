TASK 03
TIC-TAC-TOE WEB APPLICATION

Thrilled to announce my latest project: an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game, developed as part of my journey with Prodigy Info-Tech (Task 03)! The game was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on providing a fun and engaging experience for users.

The game features a vibrant and playful color scheme, along with an intuitive user interface that is easy to navigate. Users can play solo against a simple AI or challenge a friend in a two-player mode. The game logic is implemented using JavaScript, ensuring smooth gameplay and accurate win detection.

The design was crafted using CSS3, with responsive elements to ensure the game looks great on both desktop and mobile devices. The layout includes interactive buttons and a dynamic game board, providing real-time feedback and a fluid user experience.

This project has been a fantastic opportunity to hone my skills in JavaScript logic, UI/UX design, and responsive web development. Iâ€™m excited to keep growing with Prodigy Info-Tech and can't wait to dive into the next project! ðŸš€
